    This document provides the design and implementation details of a home plant
    care system that allows the user to track several environmental factors used
    to determine watering schedule and plant placement in order to grow and maintain
    healthy home plants. Competitor solutions such as Xiaomi Mi's HuaHuaCaoCao presents
    negative feedback, especially on the reliability of the humidity sensor and
    the connection between the app and the sensors. We aim to provide a reliable
    intelligent tool that allows to trace the history of data, to alert in real time
    by notifications on a mobile application and to adapt the different sensors thresholds
    to the specificities of the plant.

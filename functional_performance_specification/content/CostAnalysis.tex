\section{Cost Analysis}
Regarding the cost we chose to divide it into two sections, the unit cost of the device and the cost of the cloud.

\subsection{Unitary costs}
The main cost of the device is from the components themselves. Therefore the following table will gather each of the selected components and their cost (converted from USD if necessary with the rate 1\$ = 0.96€).\\

\begin{table}[htbp]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Component} & \textbf{Price €} \\
        \hline
         Board ESP32-PICO-D4 & 4.95 \\
         Temperature sensor HTU31 & 5.35 \\
         Light sensor TSL2591 & 5.35 \\
         Ph sensor SEN016 & 26.00 \\
         CR2450 battery & 7.31 \\
         \hline
         \textbf{Total} & \textbf{48.96}\\
         \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Price of each selected component}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}

The total cost of the device's components is 48.96€. Moreover since the battery CR2450 is rechargeable there won't be a need to replace the battery as it can simply get charged once the battery runs low.

\subsection{Cloud subscription}
\textcolor{red}{Need to know how much data we are dealing with before estimating the costs of storage -Luca you need to finish rewriting the Data format section}  [cf Annexe : Figure \ref{fig:AWS pricing}].

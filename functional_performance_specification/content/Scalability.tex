\section{Scalability limits}

\textcolor{red}{Need to define a minimum amount of user for the company not to go bankrupt ?}

When considering the absolute maximum number of users, our cloud infrastructure would permit us to have a practically "infinite" number of devices because it would be outsourced and it would be nearly impossible for us to use up all the resources available from AWS. We would, however, need to closely monitor our Cloud infrastructure's reaction times. We will first select a basic Computing Engine, but if we notice that the volume of users and petitions is straining our infrastructure, we will increase the number of instances.

\section{Conclusion}
Using the BLEPeripheral library we were able to successfully connect our phone to the Arduino board. We could then send the temperature detected by the DHT11 sensor to the phone in an hexadecimal format.\\
This first practical stage and the Bluetooth connection are essential in our project in order to send data to the server and analyze it for our users.

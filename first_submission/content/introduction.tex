\section{Introduction}
This document will aim to document and track the practical information required to effectively build and set up the Home Plant Care System (HPCS). We will explain the hands on process of connecting the Arduino board as well as the different libraries used to program the board and the app in order to send the data perceived by the sensor to the app (edge) through Bluetooth.

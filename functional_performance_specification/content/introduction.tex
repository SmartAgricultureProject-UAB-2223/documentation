\section{Introduction}
Our objective is to offer users, a way to easily track and monitor their indoor
plants, through a small device inserted in the flower pot and a mobile application.
It is sometimes hard to know how well a specific plant is doing and which type of
environment suits its healthy development. With the help of a community database
and accurate sensor monitoring we will help guide users to maintain prosperous houseplants.
This Product Specification document will aim to document and track the necessary
information required to effectively define architecture and system design of the
Home Plant Care System (HPCS).

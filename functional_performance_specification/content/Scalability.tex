\section{Scalability limits}
When considering the absolute maximum number of users, our cloud infrastructure
would permit us to have a practically "infinite" number of devices, because it would
be outsourced and it would be nearly impossible for us to use up all the resources
available from AWS. We would, however, need to closely monitor our Cloud infrastructure's
reaction times.
